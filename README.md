# droplets_area_calculation
Here we present a python code for area calculation of droplets on 2d images. File "Droplets count.py" has an interface to upload photos and write the answer to .csv file. 
The algorythm of the area calculation consists of image segmentation and a contour recognition using cv2 library. The adaptive threshold segmentation instrument allows to avoid photo artifacts and out of focus droplets.
Here are some examples of droplets segmentation using cv2:
